# Django-Online-Shop
Still in progress
Django==3.0.6
bootstrap 4

My first (big project) for learning web development using Python and Django. It's still in progress because I still want to implement (and learn) new things. In this project, there are 2 types of users, customers and staff. The customers can only view the products and add or remove from it's cart. The staff, can also view, add or remove from the cart, but they also can add a new product in the shop or change the atributes of the product.
